# DnCNN_Hyper_Params
Developing a Framework to Grid Search the DnCNN

This repsitory contains python scripts that create a grid of feasable hyper parameter values for convolutional neural networks and allows for a grid search of these paramters. Given shared access to a file system, this grid search can also be run distributed.
